`DevOps 
--------
-is a combination of two words: "Development" and "Operations." Itâ€™s a modern approach where software developers and software operations teams work together throughout the entire software life cycle, from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

why use devops
-------------
DevOps was created to resolve these issues by making both Development and Operations teams work together in entire software development lifecycle. The following are some reasons why DevOps was needed:

difference between cd(continuous delivery ) and cd (continuous deployment )
----------------------------
Feature                         | Continuous Delivery                  | Continuous Deployment                 
-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------
Final release trigger           | Manual or approval-based             | Fully automated                       
Production deployment frequency | On-demand                            | As often as code passes CI            
Risk management                 | Human oversight, safer in regulated contexts | Automated recovery strategies needed 
User impact                     | Controlled feature rollout           | Fast time-to-market
